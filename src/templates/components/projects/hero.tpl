                    The computer at your desk. The phone in your pocket. The
                    console under your TV. Each one of these devices has the
                    potential to be the next big thing&mdash;something I’m
                    acutely aware of and thoroughly interested in.

                <p>
                    While desktop and mobile are my strong points, I’m always
                    willing to dive in the deep end and program something new.
                    Whether it’s a serious business application or a fun,
                    timewasting app&mdash;<em>I’m game</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also spend some of my spare time
                    <a href="/code/lab">experimenting</a> with exciting new
                    technologies and processes in order to bridge the gap
                    between humans and the machines we use.
